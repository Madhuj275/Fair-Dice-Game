# Provably Fair Dice Game

A modern, provably fair dice game built with React and TypeScript. This game implements a provably fair algorithm to ensure transparent and verifiable results.

## Features

- ðŸŽ² Provably fair dice rolling system
- ðŸ’° Real-time balance tracking
- ðŸŽ¯ Win/lose probability display
- ðŸ“Š Roll history tracking
- ðŸ’¼ Ethereum wallet integration
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- ðŸ”’ Secure and verifiable results

## How It Works

### Provably Fair System

1. Before each bet, the server generates a random server seed and hashes it
2. The hashed server seed is shown to the player before betting
3. The player's client seed and a nonce are combined with the server seed
4. After the roll, the original server seed is revealed for verification
5. The result is determined by a fair algorithm that can be verified

### Game Rules

- Roll a number greater than or equal to 4 to win
- Win chance: 50%
- Multiplier: 2x
- Minimum roll to win: 3.50

## Technical Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Ethers.js for Ethereum integration
- Vite for build tooling

- Client Seed
- Nonce
- Hashed Server Seed

The game uses SHA256 hashing to ensure the integrity of results.
